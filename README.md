The module adds a tool to provide group of customers by group of managers (users).

Manager (admin area user):
* sees only orders from his customers' group
* sees only his customers
* sees only his sales
* receives emails only from his customers

For OpenCart 3.x as well you can add a manager info block with name, email, phone and photo (for ex. in customer account area).

Tested on OpenCart v3.0.2.0
